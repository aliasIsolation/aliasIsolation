At the moment we have to manually update the Tundra build script each time we update the Boost dependency.
We only support building the Cinematic Tools portion of the mod with Boost 1.75.0 (for an x86 target) right now.

1: Get the Boost source code for Windows here: https://dl.bintray.com/boostorg/release/1.75.0/source/boost_1_75_0.7z

2: Extract the contents of the "boost_1_75_0" folder inside the archive to this folder.

3: Execute build_boost.bat.

All done!
